# Project Eikona


## Necessary Installations
Before running the application, from inside of the Windows console, make sure any necessary packages are installed by executing the commands in the following order:


- python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools virtualenv
- python -m virtualenv kivy_venv
- kivy_venv\Scripts\activate
- python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy_deps.sdl2==0.1.* kivy_deps.glew==0.1.*
- python -m pip install kivy_deps.gstreamer==0.1.*

- python -m pip install opencv-python
- python -m pip install numpy==1.19.3
- python -m pip install -U matplotlib
- pip install plyer


## How To Run
From the base directory run the following command from console:
- python -m MediaDisplayer


## Media Displayer Features
1.	Media Displayer Toolbar: Contains auxiliary features such as toggling between image and histogram display, saving and loading an image and reverting an image back to its initial, untransformed state.

2.	Display Window: Main display for the currently loaded image. Toggles between showing the image and its respective intensity histogram based on selected options


3.	Transformation Pane: Contains options for applying transformations on the currently loaded image. Certain options feature additional parameters which may be set by the user through adjusting the value of associated sliders.


## Media Displayer Toolbar:
1.	Image Display Button: Toggles off the histogram display if shown and displays the currently loaded image.

2.	Histogram Display Button: Shows the currently loaded imageâ€™s histogram as an overlay to the user. 

NOTE: The user may freely use the transform features, undo changes, save and load a new image and the histogram will update accordingly to reflect the new changes.

3.	Load Button: Loads a new image to the display window

NOTE: Loading in a new image will clear old transformations from memory. The user will have to load the old image back in if they wish to use it for further transformations or save the image before loading something else.

4.	Save Button: Save the current image to a targeted location. If the user does not specify the extension type in the image name, the image is saved as a .png by default.

5.	Reload Button: Revert the image back to its initial state prior to any transformations being applied

NOTE: Reloading the image will clear old transformations from memory, similarly to loading a new image
